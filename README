1. Performance 
run bash scripts under the root of the project
-i) Run "bash gen_profile_duration_log.sh"
Generate duration logs from raw nsight(ncu) results.
Please double check if dlog has been generated. dlog contains intermediate result for generating the figure in the step ii)
-ii) Run "bash all_fig.sh"
The bash script generates 6 figures to show the throughtput speedup in 3 networks over two devices.


2. Execution time and Shared Memory correlation
-i) Generate log file from profiling output and Run scripts
   "bash sm-cor-2080.sh > sm-2080.log"
   "bash sm-cor-v100.sh > sm-v100.log"
-ii) Check two log files ("sm-v100.log", "sm-2080.log") are generated;
    Run python script to generate correlation figures(2080SMWVansor/v100SMWVansor/2080SMWVcnnopt/v100SMWVcnnopt.pdf) and pearson's R
    "python SM_correlation.py "

3. LoP experiment
Go to lop-v100/ and lop-2080/ and run "bash run.sh" to calculate LoP values.
The printout table shows LoP between AnalyticalModeling, MLModeling, and CNNOpt Hybrid modeling.
The script takes around 20-30 min to produce LOP table and dominant time cost is to generate hybrid model and comaprison pure ML model.
Here is the explanation of the printing result 
the 2nd column shows the layer name;
the 3rd column represents model id (AnalyticalModeling -1, MLModeling 1, and CNNOpt Hybrid 2)
the 4th column is the LopP
[30, 'defo3', -1, 0.31874999999999987, 0.03376, 0.0256, 1]


[Optional] 
For recollecting profile raw data 
Under Ansor folder, we provides the source code and profiling harness in "Ansor/src_code_2080" and "Ansor/src_code_v100" for 2 machines.
Since Ansor an is auto-tuning based tool, it generates different source code in different machines. 
-i) Evaluator needs to change CMakelist.txt and set correct environment path
-ii) Create a build/ folder and compile source codes to generate executables and double check if each problem size has one executable.
-iii) Run p_tvm_all.sh to recollect profiling data 
-iv) All new generated raw profiling data(a*.csv) is under build/ folder
-v) Copy *.csv and replace raw profiling data under "Ansor/ansor_profile-*" corresponding to different machines

Under cuDNN folder, we provides the source code and profiling harness in "cuDNN/src_code/".
-i) Evaluator needs to set correct environment path in export_env.sh file to link nvcc and cuDNN library
-ii) Evaluator needs to change CMakelist.txt and build an executable "./cudnn_ref" under build/ folder
-iii) Run cudnn_profile.sh to recollect profiling data 
-iv) All new generated raw profiling data(c*-algo-*.csv) is under build/ folder
-v) Copy *.csv and replace raw profiling data under "cuDNN/profile-*" corresponding to different machines
