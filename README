We provide all experiment data and code executables

1. Performance figure
run bash script s
-i) "bash gen_profile_duration_log.sh"
Generate duration logs from raw nsight(ncu) results
Please double check if dlog has been generated.
-ii) "bash all_fig.sh"
The bash script generates 6 figures to show the throughtput speedup in 3 networks over two devices.


2. Execution and Shared Memory correlation
-i) generate log file from profiling output
   "bash sm-cor-2080.sh > sm-2080.log"
   "bash sm-cor-v100.sh > sm-v100.log"
-ii) check two log files ("sm-v100.log", "sm-2080.log") are generated;
    run python script to generate correlation figures(2080SMWVansor/v100SMWVansor/2080SMWVcnnopt/v100SMWVcnnopt.pdf) and pearson's R
    "python SM_correlation.py "
